# node-wordpress

A node.js JavaScript client for working with WordPress.

This is __not__ an attempt at creating the full WordPress API in JavaScript.
The purpose of this module is to ease the work of managing WordPress sites
that are backed by external data sources.

## Status

This module is in the very early stages of development.
It will likely be used to power many jQuery sites which will be backed by git repos.
As a result, the initial API will probably be limited to just the functionality
needed by these sites.

## License
